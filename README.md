# VIRTO 
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) - Build and Run Instructions

System Requirements:
- Python (version 3.9.7)
- A command-line terminal for running the code.



Running the Code:
1. Name your input file (data file) as "data.txt".
2. Download the code provided in the file named "vrp.py".
3. Save the code to a directory of your choice.
4. Ensure that both "data.txt" and "vrp.py" are located in the same directory.
5. Open your command-line terminal.
6. Navigate to the directory where you saved "vrp.py" using the `cd` command.
7. Run the code by executing the following command: python vrp.py data.txt



IMPORTANT: Ensure that the input file (data file) contains only numerical values and coordinate data. Do not include any string values in the input file. The correct format is as follows:

1 (-50.1, 80.0) (90.1, 12.2)
2 (-24.5, -19.2) (98.5, 1.8)
3 (0.3, 8.9) (40.9, 55.0)
4 (5.3, -61.1) (77.8, -5.4)


Output:
The code will display driver schedules, their associated work time, and the total cost for all drivers.
