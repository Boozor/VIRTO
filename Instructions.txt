Vehicle Routing Problem - Build and Run Instructions

System Requirements:
- Python (version 3.9.7)
- A command-line terminal for running the code.



Running the Code:
1. Name your input file (data file) as "data.txt".
2. Download the code provided in the file named "vrp.py".
3. Save the code to a directory of your choice.
4. Ensure that both "data.txt" and "vrp.py" are located in the same directory.
5. Open your command-line terminal.
6. Navigate to the directory where you saved "vrp.py" using the `cd` command.
7. Run the code by executing the following command: python vrp.py data.txt



IMPORTANT: Your input can take one of two accepted formats:

1. Numeric Values Only (no labels):

   For example:
   1 (-50.1, 80.0) (90.1, 12.2)
   2 (-24.5, -19.2) (98.5, 1.8)
   3 (0.3, 8.9) (40.9, 55.0)
   4 (5.3, -61.1) (77.8, -5.4)

2. With Labels (loadNumber, pickup, dropoff):

   For example:
   loadNumber pickup dropoff
   1 (-50.1, 80.0) (90.1, 12.2)
   2 (-24.5, -19.2) (98.5, 1.8)
   3 (0.3, 8.9) (40.9, 55.0)
   4 (5.3, -61.1) (77.8, -5.4)

You can use either format, but make sure that your input file contains only numeric values and coordinate data. Do not include any string values in the input file.


Output:
The code will display driver schedules, their associated work time, and the total cost for all drivers.
